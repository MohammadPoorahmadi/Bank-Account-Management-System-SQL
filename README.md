# Bank Account Management System (SQL)

## Project Overview
This project involved the complete design and implementation of a banking database. It follows a structured 5-phase development lifecycle, from initial requirements to a fully functional SQL database.

## Development Phases
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Identifying the core entities like Customers, Accounts, Transactions, and Employees.
2. **Conceptual Design**: Creating an Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram to map data relationships.
3. **Logical Design**: Mapping the ER diagram to relational tables and ensuring 3rd Normal Form (3NF) to reduce data redundancy.
4. **Physical Design**: Implementing the schema using SQL.
5. **Testing**: Running complex queries (Joins, Aggregations) to verify data integrity.



## Features
* **Relational Schema**: Structured tables for managing accounts, branches, and customer profiles.
* **Data Integrity**: Use of Primary and Foreign Keys to maintain consistency.
* **Normalized Design**: Optimized to 3NF for efficiency.

## Documentation
The full 5-phase design report, including ER diagrams and normalization steps, is available in **[Project_Report.pdf](./Project_Report.pdf)**.
